      <h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
      <p>Over the years I have held many jobs that have involved me learning and using technology.  I feel so fortunate that I get paid to do something that allows me to constantly learn.  I love the challenge of never fully knowing everything…it can never get boring.
      I also love the fact that I can get lost in it.  I can lose hours and hours just trying to figure something out – I believe I have a strong aptitude for it.
      My role at work is an IT Implementation Lead.  This role involves coordinating with many different IT specialists and teams to implement the job for delivery to the customer.
      The specialist roles I engage with range from Developers, Analysts, Architects, Network specialists, etc.  I love to learn about the different aspects from our business perspective because it amazes me what can be achieved.
      I want to learn more about IT so that I can participate more in some of the discussions and feel like I am on an equal ground.
      I think it would also help me have a more understanding of the challenges that these people face so I can mitigate risks.
      </p>

      <h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
      <p>When I was a teenager, I saw my first computer at my uncle’s house. He had instructions on writing code, and I stayed up all night following the instructions and making something work.  To be honest I cannot remember the name of the program or even what it did, I just know I was so excited about it and could not go to bed.  He lived in the country and I did not visit him very often, so I do not think I had another opportunity.  I was very sad to go home.
      It was not for quite a few years after that when I next experienced computing and it was in the workplace.  I found it all so challenging but achievable.  I discovered that I could be good at something and get paid for learning this new age thing.
      I signed up for a computer course and learnt how to touch type, learnt some DOS and learnt some basic.  It all seems so very long ago now, way before Windows.
      </p>

      <h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?  </h2>
      <p>My first full time job was as an Accountant Assistant.
      One of the main tasks I needed to do what bank reconciliations.  I had to write in a ledger every single incoming and outgoing expense. I then had to tick them off against the actual bank statement.  If they did not reconcile then I had to go over the books again and again, until it was exact.  This sometimes took hours or even days.
      The company then purchased a computer for their accounting and hired an accounting training firm to train me on the system.  The woman who trained me was brilliant and would take the time to answer my many questions each day.
      This inspired me to sign up for Certificate 2 in Computing at Tafe so I could learn more.
      I remember learning how to ‘format’ in DOS, I thought I’d try it on the work computer to ‘clean’ things up a bit.   I figured we had back up tapes so it would be fine.
      The next day when I turned on the computer and I had deleted the entire operating system was very embarrassing.  When I contacted the trainer, she was really patient and helped me sort it out.  If she had made me feel stupid or ashamed, I may have not felt so eager to try other things down the track.
      I was 18 years old and had not had a lot of exposure to computers.
      I was excited and so enthusiastic that I soon learnt how the system worked and was the master of it.  It was an amazing feeling!
      </p>

      <h2>Outline your IT experience (if any)</h2>
      <p>As mentioned above, my first role was an introduction to a desktop computer and how it could improve monotonous tasks and improve accuracy.
      While still at this employment, they introduced a Point-of-Sale system.   I soon became the master of this system as well.
      My next job was as a computer operator at an engine manufacturer.  They wanted me to enter all their stock onto the computer and run reports, etc.  
      Over the years I have worked in data entry, order fulfilment (using VBA databases I created to increase productivity), Database Administrator, Training Officer, Digital Print Co-ordinator, IT Document Composition Developer using PReS and a little perl and now IT Implementation Lead.
      I have been involved in the initiation of many new system rollouts over my time as I have been at the same company for over 24 years.  This has given me a reputation as someone who can be called upon for learning, testing, documentation and training.
      My current role would have to be my favourite as it gives me exposure to our entire IT team.  That is not to say I know it all, just that I engage with many different talents and it broadens my exposure.  I learn something every single day just by working with these people.
      </p>

      <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
      <p>Having worked for the same company since I was in my late 20s, most of my knowledge has been on the job training or I have taught myself along the way.
      I have noticed that the world out there is changing, and majority of roles expect some certification or formal education, not just experience.
      When I turned 50, I decided I wanted to keep my brain active outside of work and figured this was a win win.
      I live very close to RMIT so figured it was a good choice.
      </p>

      <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
      <p>I expect to learn a lot more about IT and the many different areas and roles that are out there.
      I hope to be able to increase my knowledge so that I can engage in more discussions with my colleagues at work.  I want to feel more like an equal.
      It will also help me engage with the developers that work on my projects.  If they have issues I will be able to better help them or to communicate the issues back to the Client.
      I may even discover many areas of IT that I did not know about and may potentially give me a new direction.
