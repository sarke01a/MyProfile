    <h1>Project Idea</h1>

    <div class="infoBlock2"> 
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The project I am proposing is a web application to assist in scheduling action items from meeting minutes.
      This tool will be used by anyone but would anticipate a Project or Administration type role that is required to hold meetings and produce minutes.
      When the minutes have been done and action tasks have been set, a calendar invite will be sent to each action task assignees.
      These invites will contain the action description, action reference number & due date as agreed in the meeting. 
      The recipient will need to acknowledge and accept ownership of the task.
      If they have not accepted, then reminder will be sent to the minute taker or chairperson.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>In my working week I attend no less than 6 or 7 meetings.
      Out of those 6 or 7, I am the minute taker and chairperson.
      On a regular basis, I kick off the meeting by following up on action items.
      On a regular basis, the feedback I receive is that they did not read the minutes and forgot what was discussed in the previous meeting.
      The amount of time this wastes for all attendees and the impact on the overall project could be avoidable.  The attendees need to be made accountable and need to accept responsibility for the task and the deadline.
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The web application will be designed and accessed via an admin user logon from the browser.  This will be provided to the user when they sign up for a yearly subscription.
      The application will also allow for the admin user to create their own user logins for their internal staff.  This will remove the reliance on web developer from needing to manage the user access.
      Different repositories can be set up to allow for relevant Project or Client meeting minutes.  To keep the information accessible to only relevant Project people.  This will assist in privacy requirements.
      The user management will have the opportunity to allocate to a particular repository and also to the actions that will be available.  E.g.:  Some users may only need read access.  Others may need the ability to edit and delete.
      </p>

      <h3>Key tasks available with this application:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Allowance for unlimited repositories</li>
        <li>Internal management of users</li>
        <li>Personalise minute/agenda templates</li>
        <li>Integrate with current business contacts</li>
        <li>Integrate with calendars </li>
        <li>Includes email transmission to contacts</li>
        <li>Text input capability for each section within minutes</li>
        <li>Audio recording functionality</li>
        <li>Speech to text conversion – linked to audio recording</li>
        <li>Action items flag and integrate with contacts and calendar (tag assignee & date due)</li>
        <li>Save minutes in a repository </li>
        <li>Allow for editing of minutes saved</li>
        <li>Transmission of minutes via email to attendees</li>
        <li>Transmission of Action items invites to assignees</li>
        <li>Acceptance of acknowledgement for Action item invites</li>
        <li>Notifications of non-acceptance of Action item invites</li>
        </ul>

      <p><br>
      The application will give the minute manager the ability to personalise their minutes and agendas with their business logo/branding, where applicable.  Or they can use some pre-set generic templates on offer.
      <br><br>
      When the minute manager starts the meeting, they will be prompted for each section of the meeting (based on the template chosen).  They can type in the feedback then and there or they can record the audio for later or both.  This tool will also have the option to convert speech to text, if the minute manager prefers.
      <br><br>
      The application can connect to your exchange contacts and their calendars (or alternative contact/calendar solution).  This will allow you to check the attendees calendar availability, send an invite and also give you the opportunity to tick off the attendees when they arrive.
      <br><br>
      During the meeting, action points can be flagged and prompt the user to tag an attendee as well as request a due time/date.
      <br><br>
      At the end of the meeting, the minute manager can send minutes out now or can save for later.  This is useful where minute manager would prefer to review the text and/or audio.  Or it will give them the opportunity to review the minutes if they have selected the speech to text option. When the minute manager is happy with the final minutes they can send out to attendees.
      <br><br>
      In some situations, if it is a quick meeting having the option to convert audio speech to text can save a lot of time.
      The application will also give the minute manager the option to automatically send action items direct to the assignees.  
      <br><br>
      The assignee will be expected to acknowledge acceptance of the action item and the due date.  If the assignee does not respond, a notification will be sent to the minute manager.
      The application has the ability to send out reminders as well closer to the due date.  This can save time and give the assignee time to look into it before the next meeting.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>The software I think may work would be Java.  Java is open source.
      I also think perhaps GitHub page can be used for the repository which is also open source.  But I have not really learnt enough about its uses yet to be sure.
      Another alternative might be to use AWS and have a bitbucket storing the data.
      I am not entirely sure how I would make it work but the theory sounds feasible if you have the right resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Skills required</h2>
      <p>I would definitely need a team that included Java developer/s and believe they could setup the software and possibly even the AWS.  
      I would need a creative or design resources to setup the initial templates – they could be hired on a contract basis perhaps.
      If we are using GitHub or AWS, then we would most likely need to pay licence fees.
      I am not sure, but I may also need someone who specialises in Network or Windows technology so that they could ensure we have accessibility for the users and also allow for connection to business mail servers.  
      An IT Architect or Solution Architect resource would be good to provide an overview of the solution.  
      A Business Analyst would be good to put together the functional requirements and document it all.  
      It is possible we might need certificates for the URLs, but I am not sure about that.
      I believe the idea is very feasible but may require some planning and thought to ensure connections are secure.  When it works for business owners, not sure if their administrators would need to set things up at their end or just allow our application to access their mail servers and calendars.
      </p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>If the project is successful and implemented, it would save quite a bit of time from a project administration side of things.
      I think it could also be valuable tool within the workplace. I know personally, I would find this extremely useful.  I spend a lot of time typing up minutes and following up people to complete their tasks that it would add efficiencies to many of the Projects I work on.
      It would also increase the accountability of some team members where they have to acknowledge and accept understanding of the tasks set for them.
