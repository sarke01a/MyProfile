      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            
     <div class="infoBlock"> 
        
          <h4>Basic Background Information</h4>
          <p>I have worked for the same company (although they have merged and had takeovers a few times) since 1997.
           I have 3 sisters that I am very close to. One lives in QLD though, so we don’t get to see each other as often. 
           I built my own home 4 years ago and live here with my 2 adult children.</p>
          <h4>Nationality and Culture</h4>
          <p>I am Australian and both my parents were born in Australia.  Our family tree can be traced back to Irish convicts coming to Australia.  
          I was raised as a catholic, but we did not actively attend church (only with school).
          The only language I speak is English.  I did learn Italian for most of my high school years as 
          I went to a Catholic school but sadly did not retain much of it.  Most likely due to lack of 
          practice.</p>

          <h4>Education to Date</h4>
          <p>1986:  Year 11 completion<br>
          1989: Certificate 2 in Computing<br>
          2020: Completion of Intro to Programming (OUA/RMIT)<br>
          2020: Completion of Programming 1 (OUA/RMIT)<br>
          2020: Completion of User-Centred design (OUA/RMIT)</p>
          <h4>Some interesting information about me</h4>
         <p>I enjoy reading, crosswords, sudoku & card/board games.<br>
          I played netball a few years ago and left with a black eye.  This sparked a lot of funny looks at work and in business meetings. 
          I then decided that my netball career was over (at the local indoor centre) and would stick to non contact sports.
          I do yoga weekly and walk every day.<br>  
          My partner is very old school and he does not like technology, he is fearful of it.  I have spent many hours assisting him with his phone or tablet and responding with, "Yes, that one’s a scam!  Don’t click on it."
          He has taught me a lot of patience.
