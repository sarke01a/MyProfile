        <h3>Logistician Attributes (16 Personalities)</h3>
        <h4>Some key attributes that I can relate to are:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Honest & Direct – can be a strength if some filtering is added. </li>
          <li> Strong-willed and Dutiful – I agree with the dutiful part, not so sure about the Strong-willed.</li>
          <li> Practical logic – Logic just seems to stand out as so obvious to me</li>
          <li> Very Responsible – my word is my promise, and a promise means everything. Very true and if I do ever let someone down it bothers me for a long time.</li>
          <li> Calm and Practical – I don't know how calm I am when I get stressed and a project is due but definitely a trait I would like to work on.</li>
          <li> Create and Enforce Order – I definitely like structure and order.  </li>
          <li> Jack-of-all-trades – I always end up being the go to person for 'how do I….', 'what does this mean…', etc.  Let's hope I can actually master something, too.</li>

        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <h3>Logistician Weaknesses (16 Personalities)</h3>
        <h4>Some key weaknesses that I can relate to are:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Stubborn, that facts are the facts...I sometimes need to remind myself to step back and hear people out. </li>
          <li> Insensitive – unintentionally harsh statements of honesty.  I have been told I can be blunt.  Certainly room for improvement.</li>
          <li> Always by the book – this is a weakness?  I guess it can make me inflexible and not open to new or innovative ideas.</li>
          <li> Unreasonably blame myself – I have beaten myself up many times if something is wrong or I make a mistake.  Does not sit so well with me.  Sometimes this can let others off the hook when they should be sharing the burden.</li>
          
        </ul>

       
        <h3>Big Five Factor</h3>
        <h4>Interpretation of results:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong><em>Extroversion. </strong></em>Individuals who score high tend to be outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins.<br>
            <strong>Score: 54</strong>  <em>(I would agree with this, depends on my mood)</em> </li>
            <br>
          <li> <strong><em>Emotional Stability.</em></strong> <br>
            <strong>Score: 70</strong> </li>
            <br>
          <li> <strong><em>Agreeableness.</strong></em>A person high in agreeableness is friendly and optimistic. Low scorers are critical and aggressive.<br>
            <strong>Score: 40 </strong> <em>(Personally, I think I am pretty friendly and optimistic. So don’t agree)</em></li>
          <br>
          <li> <strong><em>Conscientiousness.</strong> </em>Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent. Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized.<br>
            <strong>Score: 87</strong></li>
              <br>
          <li><strong><em>Intellect/Imagination.</strong></em> This factor is also often called Openness to Experience. People who score low tend to be traditional and conventional.<br>
            <strong>Score: 8</strong></li>
          <br>
        </ul>

        
        <h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
        <h4>Auditory/Tactile learner</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening.  </li>
            <br>
          <li> If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. </li>
          </ul>
            
        <p>The actual percentages show 35% each for Auditory and Tactile but also 30% Visual. </p>

        <h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
        <p>For the most part I agree with the results of the 16 Personalities test (Logistician).
          <br><br>
          Many times, I have felt stressed when I need to deliver an Assignment or Project component on time, even if I am a week early.  Sometimes I have wondered why others in the workplace just cruise along and do not worry if something is late or slapped together. 
          <br><br>
          Doing the 16 Personalities test gave me some confirmation and validation for why and how this works.  It was also pretty interesting to step back and see areas that I can work on to improve.
          Some of the strengths could also be weaknesses.  Learning adaptability when working with other personality types is an important skill to work on. 
          <br><br>
          Some of the identified negatives or weaknesses listed are things I am aware of and work hard to overcome, especially in my role at work. As an Implementation Lead, I need to co-ordinate teams and deliver the best timely result.  This cannot be done if there is conflict or unreasonable expectations.
          <br><br>
          In regard to the Big Five Factor Test, I did not feel that the results were explained well enough for me to learn a lot.
          The Intellect/Imagination surprised me as I thought I would have a least a little imagination.  Although, I do agree with the conventional part.
          I was also surprised by the Agreeableness score (40).  I know it is almost half way but I still consider myself to be more on the friendly and optimistic side of the scale than critical and aggressive.
          I will take this with a grain of salt.
          <br><br>
          For the learner test, I found the scores very close for all 3.
          I would interpret that to mean that it could go either way. Not conclusive enough for me to take it on board.
          <br><br>
          The results tell me that I learn mainly by hearing and doing as opposed to seeing.
          <br><br>
          In my experience, I feel that I learn much better when I can see what someone is doing.  I then would do it myself.  I find words can sometimes add confusion and the interpretation of the words a speaker is using can be misconstrued or misinterpreted.  
          The only real truth to learning for me is ‘seeing’ and ‘doing’.
          <br><br>
          However, when I am trying to understand text that is confusing or long, I do read it out loud. So possibly there is some weight to that.
          </p>

          <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
          <p>I think the results show that I will be pro-active in participating in a team.  I will be prepared to put a lot of hard work and effort in.  I will need to focus on managing my expectations of others who do not have the same personality.  Acceptance that others may still work hard but in a different way and suppress my urge to judge or be hard on others.  I think I have learnt this skill a lot at work while working with many types of personalities.  Still, it is very helpful to understand it and know what to work on.
          
          </p>

          <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
          <p>Having a range of different personalities in a team could add value as all participants would have their own set of strengths and weaknesses.  You could then assign each task based on the participant’s comfort zone.
            If we were to form a team full of introverts or leader or just one type of personality, the participants would understand each other better but could make the project more challenging.  Who takes charge?  Who does the background work? Who is the face of the Assignment and presents?
            <br><br>
            Forming a team based solely on personality type may be useful to deliver an Assignment, but in the workforce, you have no such control.
            <br><br>
            Rather than pick and choose a specific type of person, you would benefit more from learning about the different types and working with their relevant strengths and weaknesses.  Provide a supportive and encouraging environment within the team to allow each team member to push outside their comfort zone.  This will teach us more useful skills for the real world – like conflict resolution, communication, listening, etc.
